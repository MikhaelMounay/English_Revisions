# Welcome back to school ðŸ˜„
The "English Revisions" project is an idea I have been working on since my 10<sup>th</sup> grade to help my high school class prepare for their English exams using the handouts and exercises included in this website.

## Used Techs / Services
(besides basic HTML/CSS/JS)
 - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) & [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) & [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (used intensively for automating and webscraping purposes to get the needed data for the handouts)
